# Github copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It uses machine learning models trained on a vast amount of publicly available code to assist developers in writing code more efficiently. GitHub Copilot integrates directly into popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, and provides real-time suggestions and autocompletions for code snippets, function definitions, and entire lines of code.

Using a combination of deep learning and contextual understanding, GitHub Copilot analyzes the code you're working on and generates relevant code suggestions based on the context and patterns it has learned from the trained data. It aims to save developers time by automating repetitive coding tasks and reducing the need for manual searching and typing.
