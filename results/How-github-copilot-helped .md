# Github copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It uses machine learning models trained on a vast amount of publicly available code to assist developers in writing code more efficiently. GitHub Copilot integrates directly into popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, and provides real-time suggestions and autocompletions for code snippets, function definitions, and entire lines of code.

Using a combination of deep learning and contextual understanding, GitHub Copilot analyzes the code you're working on and generates relevant code suggestions based on the context and patterns it has learned from the trained data. It aims to save developers time by automating repetitive coding tasks and reducing the need for manual searching and typing.

**Ways in which github copilot helped in devising the tool**
1. **Increasing usability of code:** In various segments of the code that I've written, github copilot have suggested minor adjustments that increased the usability of code. For example, in the line
   >  parser.add_argument('city', metavar='city', type=str, nargs='+',help='the city to get the weather for')
Copliot suggested the "help" argument which is useful for the users to get help regarding the tool using -h flag.
2. **Auto Completion:**
   -Github copilot helped by completing the parts of code that I am writing with utmost precision in according to the code that I am writing.
   -Copilot helped me while displaying the required weather attributes by auto completing the formatting of attributes like temperature
4. **Helping in functions:** Copilot helped me to choose the best alternative available from multiple options for same functionality. For example, I have worked with argparse library many a times. But I am unable to choose the correct functions from argparse library for this tool. Copilot helped me in choosing the useful functions
5. **Error handling:** Copilot helped me in handles the errors that popped up while using the opencage geocoder api. I have used the API key at wrong place and copilot assisted me to correct the code wherever necessary.
6. **Documenting the code:** After completing the code, I have realised that I didn't write the required comments in code that I have written in my notebook. While I am trying to write the comments, copilot have completed the comments with those similiar to ones I have wriiten down.
