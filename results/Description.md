In the first result, the user prompted "New Delhi". The tool printed geo co-ordinates, weather description and many other factors like temperature, time of sunrise, sunset, wind speed and humidity.

We can see that the tool is not only recognizing metro cities but is also capable of retrieving weather of other cities like "Visakhapatnam".
